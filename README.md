In this small project, I managed to test most of the homepage buttons on the 'Registr≈≥ centras' website with very little [code][(https://github.com/regeras/registru-centras-tests/blob/main/pages/homePage.js) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24afebf0-d9aa-46f1-aa62-2b47f291cc95)

The testing found that two of the many buttons on the homepage opened new pages, which seems unnecessary on one of them, as the other opens a different page
